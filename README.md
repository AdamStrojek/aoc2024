# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenge. The Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve programming puzzles using their favorite language.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into subfolders, each containing a separate solution for a given day's puzzle. The directory structure follows this pattern:

```
advent-of-code-2023/
├── day01
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
├── day02
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
...
└── day25
    └── src
        └── main.rs
```

Each day's solution is contained in its own directory, with a `src/main.rs` file containing the Rust code and a `README.md` file providing context and explanations for my solution.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project using `cd aoc2024`.
3. Run `cargo run -p day01` in the terminal, to start Day 1 solution.
4. The program will print out the result of my solution for each puzzle.
